This is James Chang-Davidson's repository for Northeastern's CS 5610 Graduate Web Development course in the Summer 2 semester of 2023.

## Getting Started

As allowed by Professor Jose Annunziato, I am using an alternative setup for course assignments.

As such, select elements have been modified from the assignment description to fit Next.js v13 frameworks.

## Tech Stack

This project utilizes the following tech stack:

- TypeScript
- Next.js
- TailwindCSS
